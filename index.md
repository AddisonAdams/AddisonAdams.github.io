## About Me

I am currently a Statistic PhD Pre-canidate at Colorado State University, where I hope to do research in nonparameteric bayesian methods and computation. I am trying to have a good mixture of computing and theoretical background. I love to dwell on theoretical and abstract structures, but also love to code and implement my ideas. I find it very important to pass on my knowledge to others, and encourge others to explore mathematics and statistics at a deeper level. I have been a lab instructor at University of Michigan during my masters degree and a part time instructor at Washtenaw Community College. Beyond academics, I love music, cooking, and enjoying nature!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brodyee/brodyee.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
