Hello, I'm Addison Adams, a statistician and a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Statistics Department at Colorado State University. My research interests include stochastic inverse problems, random coefficient models, and design of experiments. I am interested in the applications of statistics to real-world problems including; clinical trials, economics, watershed science, and research experimental designs. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Utah Valley University. In my free time, I enjoy tennis, reading, learning new skills, and spending time with my wife and daughters.
