Hello, I'm Addison Adams, a researcher, a statistician, and an avid learner with a Ph.D. in statistics from Colorado State University. My research interests include stochastic inverse problems, random coefficient models, design of experiments, Bayesian statistics, non-parametric statistics. I take to heart John Tukey's statement, "the great thing about statistics is that you get to play in everyoneâ€™s back yard." I have experience with the application of statistics to real-world problems including; testing and evaluation of military systems, clinical trials, economics, watershed science, and research experimental designs.

In my free time, I enjoy tennis, reading, learning new skills, and spending time with family and friends.
