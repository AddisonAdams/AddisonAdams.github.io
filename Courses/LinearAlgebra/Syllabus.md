# Syllabus

### Course Information
- Instructor: Brody Erlandson
- Instructor Email: beerlandson at wccnet.edu
- Class Meeting times: Tuesday and Thursday 1:00 pm to 3:55 pm
- Office Hours: TBD

### Course Overview
This is a first course in linear algebra. Topics include:

- Systems of Linear Equations, Vector Equations, Matrix Equations
- Matrix Algebra, Matrix Partitions and Factorizations
- Determinants
- Matrix Inverses, Invertible Matrix Theorem
- Vector Spaces, Subspaces
- Linear Independence, Bases, Dimension
- Null and Column Spaces, Rank
- Linear Transformations on Vector Spaces, Kernel, Range
- Injective, Surjective, Bijective Mappings; Isomorphism
- Eigenvalues and Eigenpsaces, Diagonalization
- Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonal Matrices, Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
- Least-Squares Approximation
- Diagonalization of Symmetric Matrices


### Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Solve systems of linear equations
- Compute determinants and inverses of matrices
- Apply the fundamental theorems of linear transformations on vector spaces
- Apply the basic theorems of inner product spaces
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors and use them in applications
- Calculate the least-squares solution to a system of linear equations

### Required Materials
Textbooks: 
- Linear Algebra and Its Applications by David Lay, et al. 5th Edition ISBN-13:9780321982650

or you can use

- A First Course in Linear Algebra, by Robert Beezer. This a *free*, Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook, available [here](http://linear.ups.edu/html/fcla.html)

### Time Commitment
To meet the due dates on the schedule, expect to spend 8 to 12 hours per week for this 4 credit course during a 15 week semester, 10 to 14 hours during a 12 week semester, and 11 to 16 hours during a 10 week semester.  Some students will probably need to spend longer, and a few might not need to spend as much.

### Grading
- Grades are posted in Blackboard under My Grades.
- Grading is typically completed within a week of the assignment due date.

### Determining Your Grade
Your grade in the course will be based on ***X*** quizzes, 2 midterm exams, and a final exam.  Quizzes will be 4 points each, and exams will be 100 points each.

| Graded Items | Percent|
| :---         |  :---: |
| Quizzes      |   20%  |
| Exam 1       |   30%  |
| Exam 2       |   30%  |
| Final Exam   |   20%  |

You lowest ***X*** quizzes will be dropped. Also, the final exam can replace your *lowest* exam score. So if you got a 90% on the final, an 88% on exam 2, and a 70% on exam 1, then exam 1 would be replaced with the 90%. This **does not** go the other way! Meaning if you got a 90% on the final, a 95% on the exam 2, and a 93% in the exam 1, your grades will not change. Neither exam 1 nor exam 2 will replace the final. Below is the total course percent, with a corresponding grade:

| Letter Grade | Percent Range |
| :---         |    :---:      |
| A            |   100% - 93%  |
| A-           |   92% - 90%  |
| B+           |   89% - 87%  |
| B            |   86% - 83%  |
| B-           |   83% - 80%  |
| C+           |   79% - 77%  |
| C            |   76% - 73%  |
| C-           |   73% - 70%  |
| D+           |   69% - 67%  |
| D            |   66% - 63%  |
| D-           |   63% - 60%  |
| F            |   59% - 0%   |

### Makeup Exams and Quizzes
There are ***no makeup quizzes***. The drops are supposed to be used for unforeseen situations, like a car breaking down or anything else. Though quizzes can be drop due to low performance, this is not the purpose. If you don't feel like taking the first ***X*** quizzes, then have something happen later on, you cannot make up that quiz. So save your drops until the end of the semester if you want to use them for not taking them. Makeup exams will only be given in extraordinary circumstances at the instructorâ€™s discretion.

### Communication
Email Communication
- Please send emails from your WCC account to be in compliance with federal privacy regulations.
- Put the course number and section number in the subject line.
- Always include your first and last name in the email message.

### Expectations and Availability of Instructor
I will usually respond to email within 24 hours on weekdays (Monday to Friday), and will rarely respond on the weekends. If I do not respond within 24 weekday hours, please send a follow up email. You should make a habit of checking your WCC email on a regular basis as well. 

### Changes of Schedule and Syllabus
The instructor has the ability to change the schedule and syllabus throughout the semester. Though changes will try not to be made, when/if they are, students will be imidately updated. 

**By staying in the course the students agree to the terms stated in the syllabus**
