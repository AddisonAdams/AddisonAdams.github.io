From the lecture on *"Linear Independence and Dependence, Inner Products and Orthogonal Sets, and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization"*, do the following questions.

1. Given,

$$\v = \vddd{0+8i}{12-3i}{3-1i}, \u = \vddd{2-3i}{9-1i}{2+i}$$

find $\innerProd{\v}{\u}$.

2. Given,

$$\v = \vdddd{1}{1}{1}{1}, \u = \vdddd{2}{2}{2}{2}$$

find $\innerProd{\v}{\u}$ and the distance between $\v$ and $\u$.

3. From Theorem 2.1., show 3 and 6 are true. Note 6 is and iff, so you have to show both ways.

4. Given $S = \{\v_1, \v_2, \v_3\}, \v_i \in \C^3$. Also let $S$ be an orthonormal set. Show that $\u = \v_1 + \v_2, \text{ and } \w = \v_1 + \v_3$ are not orthogonal.

5. Using,

$$S = \Bigg\{\vddd{2}{4}{8}, \vddd{3}{0}{1}, \vddd{1}{4}{0}\Bigg\}$$

apply the Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization to make an orthogonal set.
